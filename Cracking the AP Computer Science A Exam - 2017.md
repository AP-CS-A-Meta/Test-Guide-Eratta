Errors found in the first edition, ISBN: 978-1-101-91988-0

## Practice Test 1

### Question 7

Answer (A) uses 'P' where it should use 'p' as argument to println(). Since (A) is the correct answer, a student could mistakenly feel that there was no correct answer.

## Question 8

The expression:

```java
b = a | | b;
```

will not compile, should be:

```java
b = a || b;
```

### Question 11

As written the code will not compile, missing semi-colons on the first two print statements.

The output is ambiguous, spaces that would not appear in the output are shown in the answers.

### Question 35

As written the code will not compile, and the conditions used for the answers (C) through (E) are not valid Java.
